# Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.

# Sample Input
# set = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 8
# Sample Output
# True
# Sample Explanation
# The subset (3,5) gives the required sum 8.

# Expected Time Complexity
# O(sum * n), where sum is the ‘target sum’ and ‘n’ is the size of array.

# Expected Space Complexity
# O(sum * n)

# Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 100
# 1 <= A[i] <= 100
# 1 <= sum <= 10^5
